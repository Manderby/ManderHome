History:
--------

This little home page was in use since 2004 on my former website manderby.com. It was way more powerful with local storage, JavaScript reordering functionality and more. In the end, I just copied the html plain text file whenever I changed my working environment and adjusted the contents manually.

Many people were amazed by the simplicity.
